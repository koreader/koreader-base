## koreader-base [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/koreader/koreader-base.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/koreader/koreader-base)

This is the base framework for creating document readers like KOReader,
an e-ink device oriented reader application for various document formats.

It uses the MuPDF library (see http://mupdf.com/), djvulibre library,
CREngine library, libk2pdfopt library and it is scripted using Lua (see
http://www.lua.org/). To gain good speed at that, it uses the LuaJIT compiler.

It all started as the KindlePDFviewer application, which has since been
greatly enhanced and now reflects this in having a new name, KOReader.

The code is distributed under the GNU AGPL v3 license (read the [COPYING](COPYING) file).

## Building

Follow these steps:

* automatically fetch thirdparty sources with Makefile:
  * make sure you have `patch`, `wget`, `unzip`, `git` and `svn` installed
  * run `make fetchthirdparty`.

* run `make TARGET=kindlepw2` For Kindle models >= Paperwhite 2.

* run `make TARGET=kindle` For Kindle models >= Kindle 4 < Paperwhite 2.

* run `make TARGET=kindle-legacy` for Kindle DXG/2/3 devices.

* or run `make TARGET=kobo` for Kobo devices.

* or run `make TARGET=pocketbook` for PocketBook devices.

* or run `make TARGET=cervantes` for BQ Cervantes devices.

* or run `make TARGET=android` for Android devices.

* or run `make TARGET=win32` for Windows.

* or run `make TARGET=generic-arm` for generic ARM devices.

* or run `make TARGET=ubuntu-touch` for Ubuntu Touch.

* or run `make TARGET=appimage` for the desktop AppImage.

* or run `make TARGET=debian`, `debian-armel` or `debian-armhf` for a Debian package.

* or run `make KODEBUG=1` to build with debugging symbols.

* or run `make` for the emulator on Linux.

## Use ccache

Ccache can speed up recompilation by caching previous compilations and detecting
when the same compilation is being repeated. In other words, it will decrease
build time when the sources have already been built. Ccache support has been added to
KOReader's build system. Before using it, you will need to install a ccache in your
system.

* in Ubuntu use:`sudo apt-get install ccache`
* in Fedora use:`sudo yum install ccache`
* install from source:
  * get latest ccache source from http://ccache.samba.org/download.html
  * unarchieve the source package in a directory
  * cd to that directory and use:`./configure && make && sudo make install`
* to disable ccache, use `export USE_NO_CCACHE=1` before make.

Device emulation
================

The code also features a device emulation. You need SDL headers and library
for this. It allows to develop on a standard PC and saves precious development
time. It might also create a suboptimal desktop PDF viewer, depending
on your view.

If you are using Fedora Core Linux, run `yum install SDL2 SDL2-devel`.
If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, install the `libsdl2-dev` package.

By default, the build system builds in "emulation mode", so following is all
you need to build the emulator:

```
make
```

The emulator uses 800x600 as the default resolution. It can be
changed at runtime by changing the following environment variables:

```
EMULATE_READER_W=746 EMULATE_READER_H=1024
```

The emulator uses a default DPI of 160. This can also be changed with an environment variable:

```
EMULATE_READER_DPI=300
```

KOReader supports "viewports", i.e. displaying only in a rectangular
excerpt of the screen. This is useful on devices where the framebuffer
is larger than the area that is actually visible. In order to simulate
such a viewport using the emulator, specify a specially crafted environment
variable:
```
EMULATE_READER_VIEWPORT="{x=50,w=600,y=10,h=680}"
```

You can also simulate e-ink refresh with the emulator. When active, only
refreshed areas of the screen are actually updated and you also get a visual
inverse flash feedback. In order to activate that mode, set an environment
variable to the number of milliseconds you want the flash to endure:
```
EMULATE_READER_FLASH=100
```
