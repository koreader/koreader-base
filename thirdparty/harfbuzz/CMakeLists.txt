# We've apparently hit a weird corner-case w/ XText where GCC/STL atomics *sometimes* horribly blow up on an ARM1136JF-S CPU w/ GCC 7.5...
# c.f., https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/5780 & https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/6024
# NOTE: Our initial approach was to only disable atomics in a very dirty manner, which only helped with the first issue.
#       This, on the other hand, appears to help with both.
